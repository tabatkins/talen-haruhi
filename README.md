# talen-haruhi

An analysis of just what Talen was doing with their Haruhi posts over 2021.

In 2021, Talen Lee (of [Invincible Ink](https://press.invincible.ink/))
wrote a series of 8 blog posts,
spread thruout the year,
about the anime "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimaya",
and particularly about the 8-episode sequence "Endless Eight",
which demonstrates a time loop
by having 8 episodes in a row that are *almost completely identical*.

They did this by writing 8 blog posts about Endless Eight,
which are also almost completely identical.
I've collected those posts here,
with the HTML reformatted for easier diffing.
Each commit to `eight.html` is a successive version of the blog post,
so the diffs for each show the differences.

Unfortunately, most of the differences in any given post's HTML are irrelevant;
just frameworky stuff emitted by their blogging engine.
So, here are the *relevant* diffs between each post:

-       <p>Anime is an art movement that has encapsulated thousands of different competing threads and there’s no true centralising canon because it’s fragmented across all sorts of cultural anchor points. Australians of my age that are into anime so often got started because Aggro’s Cartoon Connection screened <em>Sailor Moon</em>, the ABC screened <em>Twins of Destiny </em>and <em>Amazing Cities of Gold</em>, and SBS, in the late 90s, screened <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, meaning that those four anime are sometimes seen as ‘common ground’ topics. Common ground for one age bracket in one country, and even then, only sometimes.</p>
-       <p>There are some events that can be looked upon, in the english-speaking anime fandom, though, in terms of their impact on shared cultural spaces, typically conventions, but also just, anime releases that somehow managed to be widespread enough at the right time that they became foundation to the conversation. The big three of Naruto, Bleach and One Piece. Evangelion movies. Fullmetal Alchemist, then Fullmetal Alchemist <em>again</em>. A collection of trans girls and boys and nonbinary people that can trace a lineage from <em>Ranma 1/2</em>.</p>
-       <p>There is a category of people I can annoy <em>enormously </em>by responding to a Touhou picture with <em>which anime is this from?</em></p>
-       <p>There’s only so much room for any given series to suck up a lot of the oxygen in the fandom space. You can’t typically have five or six ‘big name’ anime that ‘everyone’ has an opinion on. One of those ‘event’ Anime, that rose, became incredibly prominent, and then deformed the culture at large, becoming one of the rings in the tree trunk that is this strange cultural enclaves, was the franchise known as <em>Haruhi Suzumiya</em>.</p>

-       <p>Haruhi Suzumiya is a character, central to the media franchise of light novels and two different anime and movies and videogames and so many media merchandising opportunities and there’s <em>so much stuff</em> and it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s hard to get a handle on it all. The root of the story that Haruhi is part of, which started as a series of light novels, is told through meeting a boring young man named Kyon who is living a boring teenage high schooler life, until an extremely extra young woman named Haruhi enters his life. I say ‘extremely extra’ but she’s basically a classic <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">chuunibyou before that word had entered mainstream anime consciousness. </span></span></p>
-       <p>Chuunibyou, or <em>chuuni</em>, as it’s known amongst my weeb friends who are also all insistent they’re time travelling witches from Gensokyo, and I do mean more than one of them, is known as ‘middle school sickness’ or ‘being a really imaginative young kid.’ It’s this social phenomenon where someone will describe themselves as being special or haunted or magical or whatnot, and it’s seen as sort of a thing to grow out of. In this case, Haruhi establishes her chuuni credentials by establishing very firmly that she is not interested in forming friendships with anyone mundane or normal, but if anyone in the room is an alien or time traveller or ESPer they should contact her, because that’s what <em>actually </em>interests her.</p>

-       <p>Most infamously for people who weren’t watching it, though, was the <em>dance</em>. See, the ending of each episode of Haruhi was the characters doing a dance. I don’t know if it <em>was </em>technically impressive but it was <em>visually memorable</em> and it didn’t look like other things. And <em>that </em>made it memeable, and <em>that </em>meant that suddenly you’d see fanart of characters you did know doing something they’d never and in-person performances from both cosplayers and just <em>people at conventions</em>.</p>

-       <p>There was one episode, called Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, and it was built out of something beloved in the fandom, and there was much rejoicing. Then there was another episode, called Endless Eight, which was oh hey, this is about a time loop and that was that thing the light novel did by repeating a chapter. And then, the next episode is the same.</p>

-       <p>Out of a 14 episode long anime season, 8 episodes were <em>nearly identical</em>; similar scripts, similar scene composition, similar costuming, the <em>same</em> sequence of events, with only minor changes between them. And they weren’t shortcutting <em>anything</em> in them, no ‘well you know about this scene already so we’ll jump through it fast.’ What’s more, the actual events the episode focused on wasn’t action packed or social tangling or jammed with hot hot fanservice but was instead a nice breather episode showing the characters basically durdling around with the last days of their summer vacation.</p>

-       <p>I didn’t experience this personally; when I watched Season 2, I watched it on DVD. And I watched every single one of the episodes. I didn’t see it coming. I didn’t know it was going to happen, so instead, the second episode I had a moment of : Hang on, did my DVD player skip? Is something wrong? Or wait, no, this seems different.</p>

-       <p>By episode six I had worked it out. But by then I’d lost track of how many episodes it was. Eventually, I had to give up and look on the internet and be jolly amused that <em>oh damn</em>, they <em>really did that</em>. That’s <em>cool</em>.</p>

-       <p>This isn’t to say that there’s something <em>right </em>there, but in anime fandoms especially, we have a history of when anime fans and showrunners were at odds with one another. You can look to the ongoing procession of <em>Evangelion</em>, a show that was twenty six episodes long, and that <em>concluded</em> in 1996, and yet which also was supposed to have a cinematic release <em>continuing to conclude </em>that story<strong> <em>this week</em></strong>. The history of <em>Evangelion </em>is this sequence of a work being made from this really weird, intimate, personal place with real-world limitations, but where what was delivered was seen as <em>not good enough</em>, and so, there was a demand for more. There’s a whole dialogue about how <em>Evangelion </em>has basically become a merchandising wing where once upon a time there was a story with a point, and now it’s this <em>brand</em>.</p>

-       <p>Yet it drove people away, so we say. People who were invested in the series, despite everything it’d done <em>prior </em>to this point, stopped touting how much they loved it. Haruhi-ism took a blow, as a cultural joke, and boy… lemme tell you, repetition? In <em>religion</em>? If your religion’s biggest trial is asking you to watch an anime episode seven times more, <em>boy</em> you wouldn’t last through catechism.</p>

-       <p>I love <em>Endless Eight</em>. I love the Haruhi franchise. I love this anime, despite the fact that the protagonist <em>honestly grates on me</em>. I got tired of the dance at cons, I got even more tired of people ‘preaching’ Haruhi-ism ironically. I haven’t gone back to rewatch <em>Endless Eight </em>any time recently, because uh, thanks Funimation.</p>
