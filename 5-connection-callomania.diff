        <p>Haruhi Suzumiya is a character, central to the media franchise of light novels and two different anime and movies and videogames and so many media merchandising opportunities and there’s <em>so much stuff</em> and it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s hard to get a handle on it all. The root of the story that Haruhi is part of, which started as a series of light novels, is told through meeting a boring young man named Kyon who is living a boring teenage high schooler life, until an extremely extra young woman named Haruhi enters his life. I say ‘extremely extra’ but she’s basically a classic <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">chuunibyou before that word had entered mainstream anime consciousness (which probably relates to the release date of the anime <em>Chuunibyou</em>). </span></span></p>
        <p>Chuunibyou, or <em>chuuni</em>, as it’s known amongst my weeb friends who are also all insistent they’re time travelling witches from Gensokyo, and I do mean more than one of them, is known as ‘middle school sickness’ or ‘being a really imaginative young kid.’ It’s this social phenomenon where someone will describe themselves as being special or haunted or magical or whatnot, and it’s seen as sort of a thing to grow out of. In this case, Haruhi establishes her chuuni credentials by establishing very firmly that she is not interested in forming friendships with anyone mundane or normal, but if anyone in the room is an alien or time traveller or ESPer (there’s a whole category of things ‘ESP’ covers in Japanese pop culture), they should contact her, because that’s what <em>actually </em>interests her.</p>
        <p>Kyon is none of those things, and Haruhi is mad at how normal he is, and mad at how normal she is, and bullies him into joining a club with her dedicated to the task of finding those people who she deems as interesting. Her choices are kinda stupid, though, picking a girl because she’s easily bullied and has big boobs, a boy because he’s pliable and mysterious, and a girl because she was in the clubhouse at the time.</p>

        <p>Now, you might think this is an interesting new idea, but it’s <em>kind of not </em>– there’s a history of anime and manga and other stories about keeping a powerful entity distracted, a monkey with a shotgun that needs some kind of control or containment. If nothing else, <em>It’s A Good Life </em>is a <em>Twilight Zone </em>episode that first aired in 1961, where the story is oriented around satisfying the whims of a small child with godlike powers. In that story, of course, the child is aware of their power or at least aware of how they are different (<em>probably??</em>) and the whole town is in on the terrifying secret.</p>
        <p>It’s also not unlike anime in general to say ‘this character is important and it’s our job to keep them happy, even if they’re an asshole’ – that’s more often the premise of a single episode, and it’s a stock episode plot after someone gets injured in the west. To spin an entire series out of it requires there to be a layer of complication that you can use to do different things, which in this case, is presented by the four competing needs of the group around her, who are each individually, perfectly interesting and legitimate premises for entire urban science fiction narratives of their own, and Itsuki and Kyon.</p>
        <p>Now, meritocracy is <em>fake</em> so let’s not get fooling ourselves into thinking that this series succeeded <em>because </em>it was smart and funny and charming and good, but, thankfully, it <em>was also</em> smart and funny and charming and good, and it succeeded. The characters had appeal, the light novels were clever in interesting ways that were both legitimately smart but also made you feel really smart for getting them and appreciating how they worked, and did a bunch of interesting things with their idea space, including notably, one time when to represent a time loop, two chapters of a book, back to back, were identical up until the very end. Put a pin in that one, we’re coming back to it later.</p>

        <p>The light novels got an anime adaptation, and that anime adaptation didn’t just operate on interpreting the basic stories of the light novels but on redoing them for the TV format, with some of the basic plot structures all the same, but the actual narrative of the TV show <em>deliberately</em> doing some things confusingly, differently, and also with some <em>extremely </em>marketable details like fanservice and a opening song that was a bop and bringing moe girls to life in a way that audiences <em>just hecking loved</em>. There was a real love of music in the series, too, with a major music number given special attention in the first season, which served not just to be a pretty good musical performance and a real fun moment in the story, <em>and </em>a great song, but also showed animation doing a <em>really </em>impressive job of conveying something <em>real</em>.</p>
        <p>Most infamously for people who weren’t watching it, though, was the <em>dance</em>. See, the ending of each episode of Haruhi was the characters doing a dance. I don’t know if it <em>was </em>technically impressive (odds are good, it’s <em>not</em>, per se), but it was <em>visually memorable</em> and it didn’t look like other things. And <em>that </em>made it memeable, and <em>that </em>meant that suddenly you’d see fanart of characters you did know doing something they’d never done, fan animations (when they were newish!), and even in-person performances from both cosplayers and just <em>people at conventions</em>.</p>

        <p>The second season of Haruhi was announced with much fanfare, and by much fanfare, I mean it was practically something you needed to do an actual scavenger hunt to piece together the information. It was cancelled in secret (??) and then restarted in secret (???) but you could see those statements together, it was promoted, it was advertised, things happened, it’s genre media in a specialised niche, things <em>happened </em>in a way that was complicated. Then, the series <em>finally</em> started to air, and there was much rejoicing.</p>
        <p>There was one episode, called Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, and it was built out of something beloved in the fandom, and there was much rejoicing. Then there was another episode, called Endless Eight, which was oh hey, this is about a time loop, in August, hence ‘eight’ and ‘endless,’ and that was that thing the light novel did by repeating a chapter. And then, the next episode is the same.</p>

        <p>Okay, let’s just give you the most rudimentary and obvious point here: The entire point of the <em>Endless Eight</em> is characters trapped inside a time loop working out what’s going on little by little despite being literally powerless to address it in the face of the impossibility of their situation. This narrative was told by presenting a time loop where you had to work out what was going on little by little and being literally powerless to address it in the face of your impossible situation. The time loop is a sense of helplessness, of <em>growing </em>helplessness, of an <em>agony, </em>and then, then, <em>then</em>, at the end,</p>

        <p>I’ve talked about <a href="https://press.invincible.ink/whats-fanagement/"><em>Fanagement</em></a>, but what sometimes gets lost is that fanagement is the <em>second</em> term of its type to come up. The first was <strong>fantagonism</strong>, an idea that started out in a hazy time during the 1970s where showrunners were told<em> that they had to fight their fans</em>. That fans demanded ownership, that fans demanded control, that fans would take your show from you if you let them, and that meant that running the show stopped being about doing a job and started being about guessing at something a nebulous other could do, and with things like Zebracon (a gay fanfic convention for fans of <em>Starsky and Hutch</em>) showing that what the fans wanted was sometimes <em>deeply inimical</em> to what you, the showrunner, wanted to do.</p>
        <p>This isn’t to say that there’s something <em>right </em>there, but in anime fandoms especially, we have a history of when anime fans and showrunners were at odds with one another. You can look to the ongoing procession of <em>Evangelion</em>, a show that was twenty six episodes long, and that <em>concluded</em> in 1996, and yet which also was supposed to have a cinematic release <em>continuing to conclude </em>that story<strong> in January of 2021</strong>. The history of <em>Evangelion </em>is this sequence of a work being made from this really weird, intimate, personal place with real-world limitations, but where what was delivered was seen as <em>not good enough</em>, and so, there was a demand for more. There’s a whole dialogue about how <em>Evangelion </em>has basically become a merchandising wing where once upon a time there was a story with a point, and now it’s this <em>brand</em>.</p>
        <p>Now, there is a commonality there of course. <em>Endless Eight </em>was a filler arc. It was literally done as a way to stretch budget while the otherwise ballooning costs of the creation of the <em>Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya.</em> But it wasn’t done cheaply; it was animated differently each time, though with nothing too challenging. It was scripted differently, creating the impression that things were <em>almost </em>the same, but not <em>quite </em>the same. It was done with a strong feeling of continuity, where background elements like sofas and walkways were all the same colour, but things that could change day to day like outfits and movement of bugs were different. There was a lot of work put into this cheaper sequence, which I find interesting. The cheapest version of this can be produced for the budget of a single episode, but they didn’t do that. They definitely made a <em>cheap</em>er set of episodes, but not a <em>cheap</em> episode.</p>
        <p>Yet it drove people away, is the narrative. People who were invested in the series, despite everything it’d done <em>prior </em>to this point, stopped touting how much they loved it. Haruhi-ism took a blow, as a cultural joke, and boy… lemme tell you, repetition? In <em>religion</em>? If your religion’s biggest trial is asking you to watch an anime episode seven times more, <em>boy</em> you wouldn’t last through catechism.</p>

        <p>And look — I don’t need an <em>excuse</em> for <em>Endless</em> <em>Eight</em>. It’s definitely justified to work the way it did; simply put, they didn’t have the budget to do bigger or better versions of what they did. Normally, I’d discard extrinsic influences like that, when they don’t have an impact on the narrative (though I know, <em>Korra</em>). The thing is, <em>The Melancholoy of Haruhi Suzumiya </em>is a television series that played with its medium. It was a TV show that used the fact it was a TV show to be part of the show, and it used the fact that it was loved by extremely online nerds to fill itself with details and rewatch value and references that were all about <em>playing </em>with its place. The show was screened out of order. It used announcements to mess with audience. It shifted animation style at times. It <em>deliberately </em>opened with an episode that was <em>incomprehensibly </em>weird.</p>
        <p><em>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</em> and its connected works is, and has <em>always been</em> a deliberately meta-aware piece of media that wants to <em>resist </em>easy engagement. It wants to make its audience <em>fight </em>with it.</p>
